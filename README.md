# Cloud Foundry Cassandra Service Broker

A BOSH release of a Cassandra Service Broker for Cloud Foundry (does not contain cassandra itself).

## Register the Service Broker<a name="register_broker"></a>

### BOSH errand

BOSH errands were introduced in version 2366 of the BOSH CLI, BOSH Director, and stemcells.

```
$ bosh run errand broker-registrar
```

Note: the broker-registrar errand will fail if the broker has already been registered, and the broker name does not match the manifest property `jobs.broker-registrar.properties.broker.name`. Use the `cf rename-service-broker` CLI command to change the broker name to match the manifest property then this errand will succeed.

### Manually

1. First register the broker using the `cf` CLI.  You must be logged in as an admin.

    ```
    $ cf create-service-broker apache-cassandra BROKER_USERNAME BROKER_PASSWORD URL
    ```

    `BROKER_USERNAME` and `BROKER_PASSWORD` are the credentials Cloud Foundry will use to authenticate when making API calls to the service broker. Use the values for manifest properties `jobs.cf-cassandra-broker.properties.auth_username` and `jobs.cf-cassandra-broker.properties.auth_password`.

    `URL` specifies where the Cloud Controller will access the Cassnadra broker. Use the value of the manifest property `jobs.cf-cassnadra-broker.properties.external_host`.

    For more information, see [Managing Service Brokers](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html).

2. Then [make the service plan public](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html#make-plans-public).
